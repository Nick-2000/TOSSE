# TOSSE
An Efficient 51 lines Matlab code for topology optimization.

TOSSE (Topology Optimization Same Size Elements) is a Matlab code for 2D and 3D topology design problems. 
The code uses the classic 88 lines code known as TOP88 as basis in order to develop an evolutionary algorithm that, at every iteration, hard kills the elements. The new code is comprised of 51 lines without sacrificing any readability, making it useful for practitioners who want to approach the field.
